# 
# Adherence to the guidelines both in ANC and PPC will be very interesting. Your findings might highlight that implementation strategies are needed to improve coverage. Setting targets and monitoring progress will therefore be important.
# 
# The diagnostic blood glucose thresholds for gestational diabetes in the WHO criteria are set by an odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 for adverse outcomes in the HAPO-study, and should be based on any one of the following values:
#   •	Fasting plasma glucose = 5.1-6.9 mmol/l (92 -125 mg/dl)
# •	1-h post 75g oral glucose load >=10.0 mmol/l (180 mg/dl)
# •	2-h post 75g oral glucose load 8.5 – 11.0 mmol/l (153-199 mg/dl)
# 
# Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy should be diagnosed if one or more of the following criteria are met:
#   •  fasting plasma glucose > 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL)
# •  2-hour plasma glucose > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) following a 75 g oral glucose load
# •  random plasma glucose > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) in the presence of diabetes symptoms
# 
# A fasting blood glucose threshold at 5.1 is quite low, and might identify a large proportion of the pregnant population. Gaza is doing fasting blood glucose today. It will therefore be very interesting to have a look at the distribution (graph) of the fasting values, and the proportion of women having 5.1 -6.9 mmol/l, and 7 and above. You can also identify the proportion of women having a fasting value of 5.3-6.9 mmol/l or below. The reason is that an OR 2.0 for adverse outcomes in the HAPO-study gives the following values: 5.3, 10.6 and 9.0 mmol/l for fasting, and 1 and 2 h post-challenge glucose respectively. This is what we use in Norway. You can ask them if they are planning a cohort study to identify the proportion of women having 1-h and 2-h blood glucose thresholds. 
# 
# Blood glucose thresholds is one challeng, another is the screening strategy. To offer the OGTT at 24-28 weeks to all women might not be feasible in all settings. We are not doing this in Norway. The fasting value has been used to rule in and rule out GDM – Only women with fasting values between 4.5-5.0 perform 75g OGTT, if 5.1 is the GDM diagnostic threshold value.  It might therefore also be interesting to identify this proportion. Risk-factor-based screening with risk factors treated categorically (e.g. age ≥25 years, BMI ≥25 kg/m2, family history of type 2 diabetes, previous GDM and adverse outcome, non-white ancestry, macrosomia) is not the best, but used in Norway and elsewhere. You can therefore identify the proportion para0 women with age ≥25 years,  and para0 women with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 at booking (first trimester).

# Birth outcomes are important, e.g large-for-gestational age infants (LGA), and primary Caesarean section rate. However, I don’t know the quality of the data you have from newborn or PPC., and the link with ANC glucose values. 
# 
# Some women might enter their pregnancy with unknown type 1 or 2 diabetes. It is therefore very important to identify these women as soon as possible. HbA1c can be used to identify undiagnosed type 1 or 2 diabetes in early pregnancy. The data you have on blood glucose values from booking might not be valuable if your denominator is not representable.
